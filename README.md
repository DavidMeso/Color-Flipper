# Color-Flipper
 A color flipper with two kinds of methods



## <p style="text-align: center"> METHOD 1 </p>
<ul>
    <li> 
        The 1st method for creating this color flipper is the use of
        an unassigned variable which is later assigned in a function with
        <b>Math.random() method, toString() method and substring() method 😮</b>.
        And linking the function to an event listener that is added to the DOM 🤩.
    </li>
</ul>

## <p style="text-align: center"> METHOD 2 </p>

<ul>
    <li> 
        The 2nd method for creating this color flipper is the use of
        an array with some colors which is later returned in a function with
        <b>Math.random() method, Math.floor() method and multiplying it to the
        arrays length 😮</b>.
        And linking the function to an event listener that is added to the DOM 🤩.
